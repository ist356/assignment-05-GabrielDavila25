## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

Assignment 5 was definitely a bit of a rollercoaster! Diving into the whole ETL pipeline with pandas was no joke, and honestly, I felt lost at a few points. Setting up VS Code and getting the tests to run was a good warm-up, but I quickly realized this was more than just a couple of data cleaning steps – it was about thinking through the entire pipeline from extraction to transformation to loading. One spot I got really hung up on was merging the survey data with the cost-of-living data. The city formats didn’t match, and it took a bunch of tries to get them aligned. I went back and forth tweaking functions in pandaslib.py and re-running the tests. I’ll admit, I had to peek at the solution folder more times than I’d like to admit, but it helped me get over some of the bigger humps. The highlight, though, was normalizing salaries for cost of living – it felt like I was really doing something useful with the data. It made me feel more connected to the purpose behind all these steps and kept me motivated, especially when I started seeing the numbers make sense. By the time I got to load.py, I was pretty drained, but thankfully, most of that part was already set up. So I could focus on making sure the previous steps were solid. Now, looking back, I feel way more comfortable with pandas and more aware of what a real data pipeline actually takes. It wasn’t easy, but each little win along the way made it worth the grind!
